# About Together Foundtion

Web development has never been so complex and exciting as it is today. New tools, libraries, frameworks and plugins emerge every other day and there is so much to learn. It is imperative that newcomers to the web team are guided to embrace this evolution of the web application, learn to navigate the ecosystem with ease, and get productive in shipping code to our users as fast as possible. We have come up with a study guide to introduce why we do what we do, and how we handle front end at scale.

We have made a self learning platform for those who were not able to access and afford the study materials offline. The name of our web application is Together Foundation. The site is responsive with best user experience.

# Technologies Used

Frontend :-

Html,
Css,
Javascript,
Reactjs,
Redux,
React-Router,

Backend :-

Django Framework,
Postgresql Database

# Working

First of all user is directed to Login/Signup page. Here user can first signup id he is a first comer and after signup he can login logout as per his convineince.
After login user is directed to the dashboard where at the top there is navbar with hamburger menu.
Below which there are some courses.
Next in the hamburger there is catalog option and track option.
In track option he can see timeline to courses. On clicking them he is directed to modules having documentation and links.
There is add a new track option for user.
Proper hovering and css animations have been used for development.
React router has been used for single page application in associated with redux and APIs.
Database like postgresql and django framework has been used for backend development.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
